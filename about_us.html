			Poynt Energy is a Colorado-based startup, led by Amir Sajadi, that was spun-off from the scientific research developed at the Renewable and Sustainable Energy Institute (RASEI), a joint institute between the University of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder) and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). This organization operates as an independent entity. 
					</p>
					<p>
			Poynt Energy offers solutions and studies to address challenges that power industry faces related to modeling, plannig, optimization, management, dynamics, stability, and control of electric power and energy systems to enhance the reliability, security, and resiliency of energy delivery, including problems related to the integration of inverter-based resources (solar, wind, and battery) and electric vehicles, electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations, system oscillations and grid strength, grid automation and modernization, and microgrids. 
					</p>
					<p>
			The name of our company, "Poynt Energy" is inspired by the pioneering work of John Henry Poynting who was an English physicist and the developer of Poynting theorem. Poynting theorem is an extension of Maxwell's equations and explains the foundational science behind the energy transfer in power systems. Maxwell's equations explain that the electromagnetic field, where energy is stored, is composed of both electric and magnetic field vectors, 
						<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"  alttext="{\displaystyle \vec{E}}">
						and
						<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"  alttext="{\displaystyle \vec{H}}">
						, respectively, that are inseparable and lie in a plane which is transverse to the axis of energy propagation. The Poynting vector, S =E×H, quantifies the amount of power that leaves the surface in which the energy is stored and is equivalent to the negative of the work done on the charges within the volume minus the losses. The Poynting theorem links Maxwell's laws of electromagnetism to Kirchhoff's laws of circuit theory, which form
the basis for the power flow equations used in electric power networks.

				<p>
				</p>
				<p>	
			Amir Sajadi is an expert in electric power system modeling and planning with 10+ years of experience, including planning for both the Eastern and Western Interconnections. He holds his Ph.D. degree in Systems and Control Engineering from Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH. 
				</p>
				<p>	
			Amir is an advisor to <a href="https://www.latimercontrols.com/">Latimer Control</a>, as he co-invented of their core control technology that intelligently manages solar power plants, and an Expert Fellow with <a href="https://gridlab.org/"> GridLab Inc.</a>, supporting the assessment and deployment of new grid-enhancing technologies.
					</p>
					<p>
			He researches the modern power systems at CU Boulder, also a research affiliate with the NREL, engaged in advanced research to not only drive forward technological developments, but also help resolve the practical problems of the power industry, as they adapt to the new technology. His work has produced 3 patents, 66 technical papers and industrial reports. He serves as an Associate Editor of IEEE Systems Journal and a Guest Editor for a Special Issue of Elsevier Journal of Electrical Power & Energy Systems on Distributed Energy Resources and Microgrids for Energy Supply of Data Centers. He is the U.S. Representative in CIGRE WG C2.45 - ”estimation, evaluation and provision of power system inertia in networks with a high share of renewable generation”, and involved in a number of working groups and task forces in industry.
					</p>
					<p>
			Besides his engagement in technological R&D and system integration and planning studies, he previously worked as Senior Manager of Grid Modernization with PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) where he consulted utilities for automation of their processes and upgrading their control room technologies. He also has experience in product development, having previously worked as the Senior Manager of Modeling and Controls at Span.io, a startup with $231M in investment that develops software and hardware products for virtual power plants.
